## Features

- Focused snippets for common Nocterm component patterns.
- Fast `n`-prefixed completions in Dart files.
- **Right-click BLoC/Cubit scaffolding** — generate BLoC (3 files) or Cubit (2 files) from the VS Code explorer context menu.

> The coverage badge is marked as pending until coverage reporting is wired into CI.

## Install

### From source (this repository)

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Compile the extension:

   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```

3. Press `F5` in VS Code to launch an Extension Development Host.

> [!TIP]
> The extension depends on the Dart extension: `Dart-Code.dart-code`.

## Usage

### Snippets

1. Open a `.dart` file.
2. Type one of the snippet prefixes (for example `nstless`).
3. Select the snippet from IntelliSense.
4. Fill in placeholders and tab through editable fields.

### BLoC / Cubit Scaffolding

Right-click a folder in the VS Code explorer and select **Nocterm: New BLoC** or **Nocterm: New Cubit**. Enter a name (e.g. `counter`) and the extension generates the file set with `part` directives:

| Command | Files Generated |
| --- | --- |
| `Nocterm: New BLoC` | `{name}_bloc.dart`, `{name}_event.dart`, `{name}_state.dart` |
| `Nocterm: New Cubit` | `{name}_cubit.dart`, `{name}_state.dart` |

The generated code uses `nocterm_bloc` conventions with sealed state classes and `part`-based file splitting.

## Snippet Reference

| Prefix | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `nstless` | Insert a `StatelessComponent` template |
| `nstful` | Insert a `StatefulComponent` template |
| `nstanim` | Insert a `StatefulComponent` with `AnimationController` |

## Development

### Scripts

```bash
npm run compile   # Build TypeScript
npm run watch     # Watch mode
npm run lint      # Lint source
npm test          # Run extension tests
```

### Project Structure

- `snippets/nocterm.code-snippets`: Snippet definitions and bodies.
- `src/extension.ts`: Extension entrypoint.
- `src/test/`: Extension test files.

## Notes

> [!NOTE]
> Snippets are triggered via `n`-prefixed completions in Dart files. BLoC/Cubit scaffolding is available through the explorer context menu or Command Palette (`Nocterm: New BLoC`, `Nocterm: New Cubit`).
